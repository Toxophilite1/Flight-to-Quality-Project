# FLight to Quality Project
##  Overview of Project
This projects investigates the performance of the financial markets during times of global crisis.  
Included is the consideration of the phenomenon  known as flight-to quality where investors move from riskier to safer products.   
In this study three products were chosen, the safer US Treasuries and Gold, and the risker Standard and Poor’s 500 Index (S&P500) representing stocks.  
The two crisis periods being looked at was the global financial markets crash of 2008 and the Covid pandemic of 2020.  Three types of analysis was performed.
•	Correlation analysis between the products in the crisis years and the prior years.
•	Line Charts depicting the movements in the prices in the crisis years and prior periods.
•	Student’s T-test to look at the change in distributions of the daily performance of the products between crisis and non-crisis years.
The T-test was used to test the hypothesis that  difference in the mean performance of financial product in a crisis year compared to the prior year is not statistically significant, against the null.
